# CNN and KNN Models

## Project Description

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to detect gastrointestinal diseases.

## Key Features:
### KNN Classifier: 
Classifies diseases based on features or tabular data, providing an additional method for classification.
### CNN Model: 
Utilizes deep learning techniques to automatically extract features from medical images.
### High Accuracy: 
Designed for high precision in predicting gastrointestinal disorders.
### Data Input: 
Works with image datasets.

## Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras (for CNN model)
scikit-learn (for KNN model)
NumPy / Pandas (data processing)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (data visualization)
Jupyter Notebooks (for model prototyping)
